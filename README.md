ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Ojas, currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. As a full-stack and front-end developer, I'm deeply passionate about crafting seamless user interfaces and experiences that speak directly to the user's needs.

My journey in software development has led me to work with a variety of technologies including Java, JavaScript, Python, and Swift. I have a particular fondness for ReactJS, NextJS, and Tailwind CSS, tools that I believe empower developers to build efficient, scalable, and visually appealing web applications.

Beyond the front-end realm, I'm also captivated by the potential of machine learning. I'm constantly exploring how ML can be integrated into web development to create more intelligent and responsive applications.

Here in my GitHub space, you'll find a mix of projects that showcase my skills and interests. From intricate front-end designs to innovative uses of machine learning algorithms, each repository reflects a piece of my journey in tech.

Whether you're a fellow student, a potential collaborator, or just passing by, I hope my work inspires you. Feel free to reach out if you want to connect, discuss technology, or share ideas!
